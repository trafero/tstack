### Why Use The Go Programming Language?

[Golang](https://golang.org/) is becoming one of the most popular languages, however, it is still not as popular as, for example, Java, C, or Python. We wanted to, as much as possible, use a common language for system components. Go filled that need because:

* It benefits from the speed of a compiled language, yet is as easy to write as an interpreted language
* Compiled Golang produces self-sufficient executables, making it perfect for deploying to devices with limited system resources
* A variety of devices are supported with the [embd](https://github.com/kidoman/embd) library
* It has good support for message queues, databases and web programming

Some may not wish to use Go, and that's ok. The system's micro-service architecture and language agnostic interfaces mean that it is easy to drop and replace components with custom written services, in whatever language you choose.

# Contributing

We welcome pull requests from everyone. By participating in this project, you agree to abide by the

## Forking the Code

Here's a [blog post](http://blog.campoy.cat/2014/03/github-and-go-forking-pull-requests-and.html) on how to fork a go
project.

Building tstask in go (assuming you're up and running with a go already) is as simple as:

```
go get github.com/trafero/tstack/cmd/...
```

## What to Do Before Making a Pull Request

* Please use "go fmt" to format your code
* Please check that the [Paho functional tests](https://github.com/trafero/tstack/blob/master/docs/performance.md#functional-testing)
pass before submitting a pull request
